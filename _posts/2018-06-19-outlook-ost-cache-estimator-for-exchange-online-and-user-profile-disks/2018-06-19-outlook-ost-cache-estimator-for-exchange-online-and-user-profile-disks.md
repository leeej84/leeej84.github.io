title: "Outlook OST Cache Estimator for Exchange Online and User Profile Disks"

Evening all, I've recently had discussions around people needing to estimate how much storage may be needed for Outlook OST cache for User Profile Disks. I decided to knock up a quick script to achieve this.

The script I've written to do this only requires powershell 3.0 or above, you must have a login for Exchange Online and be an Admin for your Tenant in order to run the necessary commands.

The script grabs the full size of the users mailbox, the date of the oldest item and today, it then does the maths to work out how much space may be consumed for a period of a day and a month and exports this into a CSV.

All user mailboxes are iterated through, so it may take some time.

Please feel free to use and distribute as you wish.

\[cc lang=powershell\] # # Powershell script for estimating Exchange Mailbox Size per user # # Generated by: Leee Jeffries # # Generated on: 19/06/18 # #This script will loop through each user and shared mailbox and estimate mailbox cache usage per day and month for the life of the mailbox #A CSV files is then exported with the details of each mailbox, useful for estimating the size of VHD containers # #Remember to set your export location for the CSV #Export Location - Edit this location $exportLocation = "C:\\temp\\Export.csv"
