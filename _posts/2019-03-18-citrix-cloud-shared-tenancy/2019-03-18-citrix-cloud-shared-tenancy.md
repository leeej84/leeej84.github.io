There was a bit of a stir on Twitter last week about how Citrix don't provide a method for consultants or technical enthusiasts to learn about Citrix Cloud post the 30 day trial. Martin Therkelsen had the idea of a few of us grouping together to get a shared tenancy similar to the Citrix CTP's, a delightful gent Kevin Howell welcomed the opportunity to help the community and provide a subscription at cost! I offered to gather details of everyone interested so we could stay in contact and immediately sent out a Podio web form.

The response has been rapid! I've put this post together with a graph that will update in real-time with the number of people currently registered. The more people that register, the cheaper it will be.

There have been mention of other vendors chipping in also and potentially adding their solutions in an NFR manner - Simon Townsend from iGel tweeted about UD pockets for everyone involved!

Watch this space!
