### Bio

I'm an IT professional with over 15 years of experience in the IT industry. My main focus is in End User Computing (EUC) with a good amount of experience in performance testing EUC environments. I work with all large and small organisations across the IT stack, Storage, Networking and Infrastructure. I'm keen on exercise and like competing in triathlons, obstacle races and running. You will see me around at EUC Forum events as I participate as part of the steering group and enjoy being involved in community events.
